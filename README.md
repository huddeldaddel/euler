## What is Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that
will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and
efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to 
delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## About this repository

This repository contains my solutions to problems of Project Euler. I started working on these problems to learn the
Kotlin programming language. After a while I started to really like it and work on them occasionally. I'm happy once I
found a working solution to a problem and do not hesitate to use brute force methods.

Feel free to add me as a "Friend" on Project Euler if you like. My key is `1459930_QdyGQge45FGsNCpNoEw9f5XUj33eEnx3`
